   - Download monogdb from the [official website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and setup in your local system for testing.
   - Once it is setup locally, try creating documents and collections in mongodb to familiarize yourself with it.
   - You can also download the `MongoDB Compass`, which is the GUI version of Mongo Shell.
   - Once all the local testing is done, you can create a free cloud version of MongoDB in [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) and get the following credentials from the dashboard of atlas:
 ```bash
export MONGO_URI=YOUR_MONGO_URI
export MONGO_USERNAME=YOUR_MONGO_USERNAME
export MONGO_PASSWORD=YOUR_MONGO_PASSWORD

export MONGO_URI=YOUR_MONGO_URI
export MONGO_USERNAME=YOUR_MONGO_USERNAME
export MONGO_PASSWORD=YOUR_MONGO_PASSWORD
export DB_NAME=YOUR_DATABASE_NAME
``` 

- ###  Now Just, Run the project
  - To the run the project, go to the `bash` terminal of VSCode or any other code editor and run `./start_server.sh`.
